                <h4>What do I need to run a website?</h4>
                <p>You will need a web hosting provider and a registered domain name. They are prerequisites to run a
                    website and
                    must be in place as soon as the project moves from the design phase into development. In essence,
                    the web
                    hosting
                    provides you with an online space on the World Wide Web and the domain name (a.k.a. URL) is the path
                    to that
                    space. They can (and should) be bought from and registered with the same provider *.

                    The hosting package is one of the main factors for website speed so it is very important to choose
                    wisely - I
                    would
                    be happy to help with it and get everything registered and setup properly. There are quite a few
                    options out
                    there
                    but after disappointing experiences with some of the most advertised providers, I came across IONOS
                    (1AND1) many
                    years ago and have been using them since for my personal projects and would strongly recommend them
                    to you as
                    well.

                    * Web hosting and domain registration fees are paid directly to the chosen provider.</p>

                <h4>How much does a new website cost?</h4>
                <p>The honest answer here is - it depends. It depends on the style of website you are looking for as
                    they will
                    require different types of functionality (informational, online shop, portfolio, etc), it depends on
                    what you
                    need
                    me for in terms of services (web design or web development or both) and also, it depends on how much
                    extra work
                    will be required from me (photo editing, external plugins integration, etc).
                    An ideal way to get a quote is by sending me an email or a message explaining what you have in mind
                    and want to
                    achieve with your project. In most cases I am able to provide a very close figure straight away.</p>
                <br /><br />

                <h4>How long does a new website take to be completed?</h4>
                <p>The answer is virtually the same as for the question above. To give you an idea, very basic websites
                    can take
                    between 4 to 6 weeks and more complex ones 8 to 12 weeks.</p>
                <br /><br />

                <h4>How about customisations and updates?</h4>
                <p>If you are only looking for customisations and updates on an existing website, the ideall way of
                    geeting a
                    quote
                    and time frame is by sending me a list of changes you want to implement. In some cases I may need a
                    bit more
                    information but most of time I am able to provide you with a quote and time frame straight away.</p>
                <br /><br />

                <h4>How does support work after the website launch?</h4>
                <p>I am proud to say that I have kept long lasting relationships with my clients and I am always on hand
                    to help
                    them
                    whenever needed with updates and further developments. Those are usually charged on an hourly bases.
